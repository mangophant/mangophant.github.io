I am currently a third-year PhD student advised by [Dr. Li Lu](https://lynnlilu.github.io) in the College of Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I also earned my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University in 2021.

My research interests lie in AI security with a specific focus on [adversarial examples](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/03/30/breaking-convnets) and [backdoor learning](https://backdoor-learning-tutorial.github.io), especially their practical threats to intelligent audio systems. By “debugging” deep learning, my research seeks to help build trustworthy AI systems in security-critical tasks.
