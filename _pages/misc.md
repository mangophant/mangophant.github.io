#### BibFetcher

- I write a tool to retrieve and format bibliography from [DBLP](https://dblp.org/) automatically. Check it [here](https://github.com/czyxm/BibFetcher)!

#### Table Tennis

- I love table tennis for its beauty of ultimate _power_, _speed_, and _spin_.

- My favoriate player is [Hao Wang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Hao_(table_tennis,_born_1983)>). He is widely regarded as the world's best player of the _Reverse Penhold Backhand_, a fantastic technique I'm currently learning!

#### Anime

- At my leisure, I enjoy watching anime.

- My favorites (top-5): _White Album 2_, _EVA_, _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_, _K-On!_, and the _Disastrous Life of Saiki K_.
